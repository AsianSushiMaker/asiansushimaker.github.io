        Dear Daniel,
        <br><br>
        THANK YOU FOR SAYING YES TO BEING MY VALENTINE!!! I've always wanted a Valentine and I can't believe I'm going to have the most gorgeous, pretty, beautiful, cute, smart, funny, amazing, suspiciously charming girlfriend in the whole entire universe as my Valentine this year! 
        <br><br>
        I'm so happy that I'll be your Valentine for the second year in a row! Thank you for everything that you do for me - always finding a way to make me laugh, inspiring me with your hard work, and always making me feel at home. I'm so lucky to have such an amazing girlfriend and now Valentine.
        <br><br>
        I love you so so soooooooooo much and to the moon and back times &#x221e; and beyond!!!
